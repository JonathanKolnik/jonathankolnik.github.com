Why do I call them "CSS Scrollbars"? The <i>CSS Overflow</i>
property tells the browser what to do if the box's contents is larger
than the box itself. It behaves similar to inline frames and creates
scrollbars if required. That is why I call them CSS Scrollbars!

  <p>Consistent with Mrs. Carpenter's questions regarding your T shirt cost structure, inventory and fulfillment costs not yet factored in, your business plan should include your plans to achieve profitability.  
    
    -You indicate that you want to be profitable in four months, but how you get there is missing.  
    
    For example, you state that you are looking for 
    -retail placement, how many stores are you planning on have carrying your items and how many shirts do you need to sell through this channel to achieve profitability?  
    -Is selling through retail more or less profitable than selling via the internet?  
    
    -In addition, what are your marketing plans beyond your website, stickers and business cards?  
    -Will you need display materials, signage, etc. in order to draw attention to your shirts hanging in a store?  
    -What about internet advertising costs?  
    -Lastly, if email blast marketing is part of your overall strategy, will you be purchasing email lists?  
    
    
    -How many T-shirts did you acquire for $2484? 
    -Have you gone through all of those yet, or are you still printing/selling some?
    -Screens/Inks/Squeegees... which of these are consumable (which will you have to buy again for the next batch of T-shirts?) 
    -How many T-shirts did you create for each of your Revenue items?
    -Is your web site cost monthly? yearly? 
    -What are your projected expenses?  (Estimate shipping/packaging/future advertising, etc.)
    -It looks like you have made a bunch of toybox shirts (online) that you are trying to sell. Have you sold any of those?
    -At what cost did you make those? How many have you made? How much did it cost to make themtoys
